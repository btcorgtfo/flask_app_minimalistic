# Minimalistic Flask App 
Minimalistic flask application factory, to start from. Already with a blueprint configured.
## Setup
On a console, e.g. terminal in PyCharm type:
1. `git clone` 
2. `conda create -n minimalistic_flask_app python=3.8`
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. `python wsgi.py`

Output will then look like

```
